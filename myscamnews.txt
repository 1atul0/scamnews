I want to share an experience where I encountered a scammer trying to trick me.

First, I got a call from a toll-free number, +1900-283-2895. Then, after two minutes, I got another call from +1900-596-29173. After picking up this second call, an AI voice (like a customer care voice) informed me that the call was from the Telecom Department Authority and that my current phone number would be deactivated within two hours.

I was instructed to press 1 to talk to someone from the telecom department. When I pressed 1, I was connected to a person who claimed that they had detected suspicious activity from another SIM number (which wasn’t mine). They told me that this other number (8455186031) was involved in MMS video sharing, fraud, pornography, and other illegal activities.

Since I didn’t want my current number to be deactivated, I decided to ask for a solution. The person instructed me to go to the Tilaknagar Mumbai Police Station and file a report immediately.

I told them it wasn’t possible for me to reach Tilaknagar quickly. They then sympathized and offered to connect me directly to the police station. On a conference call, another person claimed that an F.I.R. had been registered against my number (8455186031) and that 17 people had filed complaints against me as the owner of this number.

I repeated that it wasn’t possible for me to travel to the Mumbai police station. At this point, they said a Sub-Inspector Hemraj Koli would speak to me. But before speaking to him, they instructed me to isolate myself in a room where no one could interrupt me.

Then, a person video-called me on WhatsApp from the number +91 7838786017. He was dressed in a full police uniform, with medals on the wall behind him, a flag on the desk, and other props to look authentic.

The sub-inspector told me that an arrest warrant had been issued against me. He said if I was innocent, I would need to prove that this crime wasn’t committed by me and that he would conduct the investigation online.

He then asked me to hold my Aadhar card next to my face on the video call. I did as he instructed, but since the Aadhar card wasn’t clearly visible, he asked me to send a picture of it. However, I refused.

I then told him that if this crime involved me, I needed to inform my parents first. He rudely replied, “If this crime was committed by you, why would you call your parents?”

At this point, I started noticing some suspicious things. I put their call on hold and called my father to explain the situation. My father advised me to first verify my SIM card with customer care and, if needed, report the incident to our nearest police station.

After ending my father’s call, I told the sub-inspector that I was going to report to my local police station. He replied, “Why are you going to the police station? The police will come to your house shortly.”

Again, I insisted on going to the police station. He finally agreed but demanded that I keep the video call on until I reached the station.

I felt like he was trying to control and intimidate me, so I ended the call. However, he kept calling me on WhatsApp—20 video calls in a row—trying not to leave me a moment to think or act.

At this point, I turned off my mobile data and went to my local police station. The clerk there reassured me that if something like this had happened, the Mumbai police would have contacted them first, not me directly.

Feeling relieved, I searched online for “Hemraj Koli Mumbai Sub-Inspector” and found multiple scam reports involving this name.

My Takeaway
My goal in sharing this story is to warn you about such scams and how creatively these scammers operate.

Even as a B.Tech in Computer Science graduate, I was almost tricked. This shows how easy it is to fall victim to such scams. Please stay alert and verify any suspicious claims.

I’ve attached the phone numbers, photos, WhatsApp messages, and other details I encountered to help you recognize these scams.

Stay safe!
